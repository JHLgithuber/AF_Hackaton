# react-native-rsa
A library which provides cryptographic functions to React Native. This library is compatible with Expo, no ejection required.

## Use Case
Other similar libraries either do not provide key generation functionality or are not compatible with Expo. This library solves both problems.

## Examples

#### Installation
```
npm install react-native-rsa
```

#### Key Generation
```
const RSAKey = require('react-native-rsa');
const bits = 1024;
const exponent = '10001'; // must be a string. This is hex string. decimal = 65537
const rsa = new RSAKey();
rsa.generate(bits, exponent);
const publicKey = rsa.getPublicString(); // return json encoded string
const privateKey = rsa.getPrivateString(); // return json encoded string
```

#### Encryption
```
const rsa = new RSAKey();
rsa.setPublicString(publicKey);
const originText = 'sample String Value';
const encrypted = rsa.encrypt(originText);
```

#### Decryption
```
rsa.setPrivateString(privateKey);
const decrypted = rsa.decrypt(encrypted); // decrypted == originText
```

Tested works with ursa in nodejs (with ursa padding set to PKCS1).

## Credits
This library uses Tom Wu's jsbn http://www-cs-students.stanford.edu/~tjw/jsbn/.
The original creator of this library is https://github.com/z-hao-wang/. The original URL is https://github.com/z-hao-wang/react-native-rsa. I (mrbros35) have updated the documentation and plan on updating the NPM version to include updated functionalities.

## TODO
If you would like to contribute, please create a pull request. Currently, the library is missing PEM handling.

## Known issues:
* Node js may complain about 'window' is not defined. I just commented out the 'window' related codes in rng.js and it worked. (It look like just adding some extra randomness. Should still work without that part). I don't recommend using this lib in nodejs. I use ursa or node-rsa lib for nodejs.
